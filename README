NAME
    Device::SMBus - Perl interface for smbus using libi2c-dev library.

VERSION
    version 0.10

SYNOPSIS
       use Device::SMBus;
       $dev = Device::SMBus->new(
         I2CBusDevicePath => '/dev/i2c-1',
         I2CDeviceAddress => 0x1e,
       );
       print $dev->readByteData(0x20);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a perl interface to smbus interface using libi2c-dev library.

CONSTANTS
  I2C_SLAVE
ATTRIBUTES
  I2CBusDevicePath
    Device path of the I2C Device.

     * On Raspberry Pi Model A this would usually be /dev/i2c-0 if you are using the default pins.
     * On Raspberry Pi Model B this would usually be /dev/i2c-1 if you are using the default pins.

  I2CDeviceAddress
    This is the Address of the device on the I2C bus, this is usually
    available in the device Datasheet.

     * for /dev/i2c-0 look at output of `sudo i2cdetect -y 0' 
     * for /dev/i2c-1 look at output of `sudo i2cdetect -y 1'

METHODS
  fileError
    returns IO::Handle->error() for the device handle since the last
    clearerr

  writeQuick
    $self->writeQuick($value)

  readByte
    $self->readByte()

  writeByte
    $self->writeByte()

  readByteData
    $self->readByteData($register_address)

  writeByteData
    $self->writeByteData($register_address,$value)

  readNBytes
    $self->readNBytes($lowest_byte_address, $number_of_bytes);

    Read together N bytes of Data in linear register order. i.e. to read
    from 0x28,0x29,0x2a

    $self->readNBytes(0x28,3);

  readWordData
    $self->readWordData($register_address)

  writeWordData
    $self->writeWordData($register_address,$value)

  processCall
    $self->processCall($register_address,$value)

  DEMOLISH
    Destructor

USAGE
    *   This module provides a simplified object oriented interface to the
        libi2c-dev library for accessing electronic peripherals connected on
        the I2C bus. It uses Moose.

see ALSO
    *   Moose

    *   IO::File

    *   Fcntl
